## Overview
The metrics component provides operational insight to your DC/OS cluster, providing discrete metrics about your applications and deployments. This can include charts, dashboards, and alerts based on cluster, node, container, and application-level statistics. 

This project provides a metrics service for all DC/OS clusters which can be integrated with any timeseries data store or
hosted metrics service. We aim to be un-opinionated about what you do with the metrics once theyâ€™re out of the system.
However you look at it, getting those metrics should be mind-numbingly simple. 


## How This Repo Is Organized
  - **[collectors](collectors/)**: The collector (input) portion of the metrics service that runs on every DC/OS node.
      - Periodically polls the local machine for:
        - OS-level metrics: polls the underlying OS for system-wide metrics such as CPU, memory, disk, and
        network utilization. 
        - Mesos agent metrics: polls the Mesos agent APIs for agent statistics, state, and dimensions.
        - Container metrics: polls the Mesos agent APIs for per-container metrics.
      - Listens on TCP port `8124` for Avro-formatted metrics from the mesos-agent module for application-level metrics.
  - **[docs](docs/)**: Project documentation.
  - **[examples](examples/)**: Reference implementations of programs which integrate with the metrics stack.
    - **[collector-emitter](examples/collector-emitter/)**: A reference for DC/OS system processes which emit metrics.
    Sends some Avro metrics data to a local Collector process.
    - **[configs](examples/configs/)**: Example configuration files.
    - **[datadog](examples/datadog/)**: Scripts and dashboards to be used with the DataDog service.
    - **[statsd-emitter](examples/statsd-emitter/)**: A reference for mesos tasks which emit metrics. Sends some StatsD
    metrics to the `STATSD_UDP_HOST` / `STATSD_UDP_PORT` endpoint advertised by the mesos-agent module.
  - **[mesos_module](mesos_module/)**: Mesos module (written in C++) to support application-level metrics. Exposes
  two environment variables to each container: `STATSD_UDP_HOST` and `STATSD_UDP_PORT`.
  - **[producers](producers/)**: The producer (output) portion of the metrics service that runs on every DC/OS node.
      - DataDog: outputs metrics to a DataDog agent running on port 8125 (if it exists)
      - HTTP: exposes a JSON-formatted HTTP API on the local node to be queried by user-provided tooling.
  - **[schema](schema/)**: Schemas shared between the Mesos module and the collector daemon.
  - **[scripts](scripts/)**: Helper scripts used to build and test this project.
  - **[util](util/)**: Helper utilities used across Go packages in this repo.
  - **[vendor](vendor/)**: Vendored libraries (uses [govendor][github-govendor])


## Getting Started
The dcos-metrics component is natively integrated with DC/OS version 1.9 and later. No additional setup is required. If you want to use the DataDog integration or ship application-level metrics into dcos-metrics, there are a couple additional steps.

### DataDog integration
Install the DataDog agent on every node in the DC/OS cluster by installing the package from the [Mesosphere Universe][github-universe]. Be sure to configure the package with the correct information for connecting to your DataDog account.

### Application-level metrics
This service exposes two new environment variables to every Mesos container: `STATSD_UDP_HOST` and `STATSD_UDP_PORT`. The process is to simply send StatsD-formatted metrics to the host and port provided to your container via those environment variables, and the metrics service will take it from there. Incoming metrics are automatically decorated with dimensions about the host and cluster that the container or application is running on.
