# Instrumenting your code

DC/OS metrics listens for [statsd metrics][statsd-spec] from every app running with the
[Mesos containerizer][mesos-ucr]. We expose a statsd server for each container, which allows us to tag all metrics by
origin. We make its address available to the application by injecting the standard environment variables
`STATSD_UDP_HOST` and `STATSD_UDP_PORT`. 

## Quickstart:

```
import os, statsd
c = statsd.StatsClient(os.getenv('STATSD_UDP_HOST'), os.getenv('STATSD_UDP_PORT'), prefix='example.app')
c.incr('foo.bar') # Will be â€˜example.app.foo.bar' in statsd/graphite. 
```

## Under the hood

The mesos instance on every agent in DC/OS has several DC/OS specific modules which extend its functionality. One of
those is a dedicated [isolator module][mesos-isolator] for metrics. When a container is started, the module reserves a
port for statsd metrics, starts a statsd server process, and injects two variables into the container environment with
the host and port for that server. Metrics received by that server are tagged with the container ID and sent through to
the dcos-metrics collector. 

## Limitations

Workloads running with the docker containerizer do not have a statsd server made available to them. Consider running a
statsd sidecar if you need to get metrics from an application running with the docker containerizer.

Statsd has no concept of a histogram; all metrics are therefore reported as gauges.
